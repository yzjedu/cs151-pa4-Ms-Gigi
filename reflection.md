The objective of this lab was to create a program to analyze headlines from a file, including tasks like counting specific words, calculating averages, 
and finding the longest and shortest headlines. The focus was on learning file handling, modular programming, error handling, and implementing user-friendly 
interactions.

To achieve this, I broke the problem into smaller tasks and implemented modular functions for each. Techniques like list comprehensions, string methods, 
and error handling with try-except were used. Testing was crucial, and I used normal, edge, and extreme cases, such as nonexistent words, to ensure the 
program handled all scenarios gracefully. A menu system guided user interactions and allowed for seamless navigation.

Key concepts explored included file input/output, string manipulation, and error handling. One challenge that I faced was making sure that each functions
ran smoothly and does what it is supposed to. Testing was iterative, ensuring robustness and reliability.

Working independently was both challenging and rewarding. It required solving problems without external input, which improved my debugging skills 
and programming confidence. Overall, the lab reinforced key programming principles, and I successfully achieved the objectives while 
gaining practical skills for future projects.
